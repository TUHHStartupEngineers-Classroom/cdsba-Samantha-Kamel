# Basic Rules of Probability

* If $A$ is an event --> $\overline{A}$ is the complement  
with   $P(A)+P(\overline{A})=1$

* Impossible Event: $P(A)=0$, Certain Event: $P(A)=1$

* Probability is a real number greater or equal to 0

* Total probability is equal to 1

* $\cup$ : Union/ or , $\cap$ : Intersection/ and


* Non-Mutually Exclusive: $P(A \cup B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ --> `Addition Rule`

* Mutually Exclusive: $P(A \cup B)= P(A) + P(B)$ as the events can't happen at the same time $P(A \cap B)=0$

* Conditional Probability:  
$P(A|B)$ is the probability of $A$ happening given that $B$ has happened  
If $A , B$ are independent: $P(A|B)= P(A)$ --> `Stochastic Independent`

* $P(A \cap B)= P(A|B) * P(B)= P(B|A) * P(A)$  
then $P(A|B)= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ --> `Multiplication Rule`


# Probability Tree

* Branches from 1 Node sum to 1  

* Probability of two consecutive events is obtained by multiplying the probabilities  

> ### **`Assignment 1:`**
Given the following Probability Tree and with defining being on time as event $T$, being not on time as $\overline{T}$, having a change in scope as $S$ and having no change in scope as $\overline{S}$  

![](../../assets/img/01 Probability/Probability Tree.PNG)  

### **Solution:**  
$P(T\cap S)= 0.3* 0.2=0.6$

$P(T\cap \overline{S})= 0.7* 0.6=0.42$

$P(\overline{T}\cap S)= 0.3* 0.8=0.24$

$P(\overline{T}\cap \overline{S})= 0.7* 0.4=0.28$
  
# Set Theory

* Venn Diagrams are used to visualize the occurrence & relationships between events

> ### **`Assignment 2:`**
Using a random sample of 1000 cistomers of application development company that has developed an app available on either Smartphones "$S$", Tablets "$T$" or Computers "$C$". Given the Venn Diagram of the number of customers using each device.

### **Solution:**  

* The percentage of customers using all three devices:
$P(S\cap T\cap C)=0.5\%$  

* The percentage of customers using at least two devices:
$P(S\cap T) + P(T\cap C) + P(C\cap S)+ P(S\cap T\cap C)=7.3+3.3+8.8+0.5=19.9\%$  

* The percentage of customers using only one device: $= 42.3 + 27.8+ 10=80.1\%$  
or $100 - P$(at least 2 devices)$= 100-19.9=80.1\%$
  
# Bayes Theorem

$P(A|B)= \frac{P(A|B)*P(A)}{P(B)}= \frac{P(A|B)*P(A)}{P(B|A)*P(A)+P(B|\overline{A})*P(\overline{A})}$  --> `Bayesian Rule`  

> ### **`Assignment 3:`**
You are quality assurance manager and you want to buy a new tool that automates part of the quality assurance. If the tool finds a product it considers faulty, an alarm is triggered. The seller of the tool states that if a product is faulty, the tool is 97% reliable and if the product is flawless, the test is 99% reliable. Also, from your past experience you know that 4% of your products come out with flaws.  


### **Givens:**  

$P(B|A)=0.97$  
$P(B|\overline{A})=0.01$  
$P(\overline{B}|\overline{A})=0.99$  
$P(A)=0.04$  
$P(\overline{A})=0.96$  


### **Solution:**  

Using the Bayesian Rule:  

* $P(\overline{A}|B)=\frac{0.01*0.96}{(0.01*0.96)+(0.97*0.04)}= 0.1983471074 =19.83\%$  

* $P(A|B)=\frac{0.97*0.04}{(0.01*0.96)+(0.97*0.04)}= 0.8016528926 =80.17\%$  

* **Verification:** $P(\overline{A}|B)+P(A|B)=19.83+80.17=100\%$  

These results show that in case the alarm is triggered, there is a possibility of about `19.83%` that the product is flawless and a probability of `80.17%` that the product is faulty.
