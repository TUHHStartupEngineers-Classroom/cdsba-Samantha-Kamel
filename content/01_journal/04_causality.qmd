### Spurious Correlation:  

According to [STATOLOGY](https://www.statology.org/spurious-correlation-examples/):  

In statistics, spurious correlation refers to a correlation between two variables that occurs purely by chance without one variable actually causing the other to occur.  

This type of correlation is dangerous because it can sometimes make people think that one variable causes another, when in reality the correlation exists purely by chance.  

It turns out that this type of correlation between variables happens all the time in real life.

#### One real-life example is **`Master’s Degrees vs. Box Office Revenue`**:  

If we collect data for the total number of Master’s degrees issued by universities each year and the total box office revenue generated by year, we would find that the two variables are highly correlated.  

This doesn’t mean that issuing more Master’s degrees is causing the box office revenue to increase each year.  

The more likely explanation is that the global population has been increasing each year, which means more Master’s degrees are issued each year and the sheer number of people attending movies each year are both increasing in roughly equal amounts.   

The correlation between the two variables is spurious.

### Data Fabrication and Visualization:  

By fabricating data similar to the previous one using a linear and a square root function with normally distributed noise, we would get a similar plot for this spurious correlation (because the noise used is random the plot and data will slightly change at each run but the concept and the plot shape are the same).  

```{r}
#Load Library:
library(tidyverse)  

#Fabricating Data:
first_year <- 1910
last_year <- 2020 
years <- seq(first_year,last_year, by=10)
rand_var<-900
n <- length(years)
Masters_mean <- 0
Masters_sd <- 5
Box_Office_mean <- 0
Box_Office_sd <- 20000
Masters_data <- years-rand_var+rnorm(n, Masters_mean, Masters_sd)
BoxOffice_data <- sqrt((years-rand_var)^2+rnorm(n, Box_Office_mean, Box_Office_sd))
data <- data.frame(Year=rep(years, times=2), data_group= rep(c("Masters_Degree_Issued","Box_Office_Revenue"),each=n) ,Data=c(Masters_data,BoxOffice_data) )
data

#Plot:
ggplot(data,aes(x = Year, y = Data, group=data_group, color=data_group)) +  geom_line()
```
